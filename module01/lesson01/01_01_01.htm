    <p>The crackle of night. Shouts from bead sellers, <em>popina</em> vendors, jug makers, tapestry traders…merchants
      jockeying for the attention of every passerby. Crowds of people in search of lively nocturnal activity in the
      Forum. The patrician's horse’s hooves lazily clinking along cobbled stone streets towards the racketing noises of
      the Coliseum. Raucous cheers and jeers, familiarly haunting to the aging gladiator. All these accustomed nightly
      sounds throbbed through the Roman air. </p>

    <p><strong><em>But this was no ordinary night.</em></strong> No, on this night, the loudest, most gut-wrenching
      shrieks of fear coming from the Temple of Vesta silenced every outside rumbling noise. Merchants stopped selling.
      Gladiators fell to their knees. Birds stopped chirping. And the sky turned a tenebrous shade of black not
      witnessed since <span class="glossary">216 BCE</span>. Every Roman—man, woman, and child—halted in their tracks
      and turned towards the Temple of Vesta. They listened, dreading to hear the news that they collectively feared…

    <p><strong>…the Palladium statue had been stolen!</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Sleuth Clues: Location and Stolen Object</strong></p>
          <p>The Palladium was a wooden statue carved in the likeness of <span class="fev_la"><span
                class="glossary">Pallas Athena</span></span>. The Romans believed that <span class="fev_la"><span
                class="glossary">Athena</span></span> herself crafted the statue. She named it the Palladium after her
            best friend, <span class="fev_la"><span class="glossary">Pallas</span></span>, whom she had accidently
            killed in a tragic accident. The statue held special powers and was highly coveted by those seeking ultimate
            supremacy. It was brought to Italy from <span class="fev_la"><span class="glossary">Troy</span></span> by
            <span class="fev_la"><span class="glossary">Aeneas</span></span>. In Rome, it was kept in the Temple of
            Vesta for centuries. <em>Now it is missing.</em>

            <p>The temple stored sacred objects, such as the Palladium and other objects Aeneas brought from Troy. The
              Temple of Vesta was chosen as the resting place of the statue because Vesta and her priestesses protected
              Rome from all dangers.</p>

            <p>The Roman Forum is a massive, rectangular area located in the center of Rome between the Palatine Hill
              and the Capitoline Hill. It was the place in Rome where Romans enjoyed gathering for social, civic,
              religious, and political activities. It contained magnificent structures, such the Temple of Saturn, the
              Temple of Castor and Pollux, the Temple of Julius Caesar, the Temple of Minerva, the Circus Maximus, and
              the Rostra.

            <p>The Temple of Vesta is a round temple measuring 14.8 meters in diameter. It had twenty columns over ten
              meters high. It was built to honor the Olympian, Vesta, goddess of the hearth. Her Vestal priestesses
              performed religious ceremonies there.

            <p>Vesta was very important to Rome’s religious institution. The Romans created the sacred Cult of Vesta, a
              strictly female cult of six priestesses known as Vestal Priestesses who tended to the hearth of Rome. This
              was the sacred fire that remained lit in the Temple of Vesta. The perennial flame embodied the life, soul,
              and eternal power of Rome. Because the Vestal maidens were responsible for keeping the flame lit, they
              were seen as the sacred lifeline of the city. </p>
