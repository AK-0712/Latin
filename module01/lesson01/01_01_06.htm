    <h1><em>Fabula Fabulosa</em>: Precious Palladium </h1>

      <p>The Palladium was magical. The Romans called it one of Rome’s <em>pignora imperii</em> or sacred tokens of
        power. Cities were founded by it. Nations fell because of it. Men fought over it. The Palladium was so powerful
        and so highly coveted that it became one of the most frequently stolen objects in history. Whoever possessed it
        would become ruler of the ancient world.</p>

      <p>Legend tells that Dardanus, son of Zeus, was the first to possess the statue. Other stories say that Athena
        gave the Palladium first to Ilus, founder of Troy and descendent of Dardanus. In either case, the Trojans kept
        the Palladium on display in their city’s citadel for centuries. When Troy was on the brink of winning the Trojan
        War, the Greeks devised two plans to seal their own victory. They constructed the Trojan Horse, and they stole
        the Palladium statue from Troy’s citadel. These were two devious, cunning, and strategic <span class="glossary" data-position="right auto">plans</span> that would cause Troy to burn to the ground and fall into utter ruin.</p>

      <p>Here's what happened…Odysseus and Diomedes snuck into the Trojan Temple of Athena, accosted its <span
          class="glossary">priestess</span>, wrapped the statue in a blanket, and carried it out of the temple. Their
        friends helped them carry the statue out through a sea of Trojans—all without notice. Diomedes sailed to Attica
        with the statue, where he and his crew were <span class="glossary">accidentally</span> attacked by Demophon, son
        of Theseus. Demophon then captured the Palladium.</p>


      <p>It’s rumored that the Greeks had actually stolen a replica of the Palladium and not the real statue! Aeneas,
        the Trojan hero, was the one who rescued the actual statue from the blazing inferno of crumbling Troy. He would
        sail with the Palladium and bring it to Italy, where it would be placed in the Temple of Vesta in the Roman
        Forum for protection. </p>

          <p>The Palladium slipped from hand to hand. After Demophon, the Palladium supposedly was captured by Erginus,
            a descendant of Diomedes. He brought it to Sparta where it was worshipped by Spartan kings. The question
            is…was this the real Palladium or its imitation?</p>
