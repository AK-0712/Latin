        <p class="mt-2"><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
        <p>Create and write a bulletin post about the missing Palladium. The post must include catchy taglines, a short
            paragraph detailing the history of the Palladium, and any current information that Detective Arcanus has
            gathered. You can use the sample template to help guide you to create your own bulletin post. </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Be creative! Be sure to include images and catchy taglines to get the attention of Romans around town.
                You can graphically present your bulletin post in any format, as long as it resembles a flyer and
                contains the required information. </li>
            <li>Information on the Palladium must come from properly cited research of academic sources.</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="mt-2"><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
        <p>Write three sentences in Latin, showcasing your Latin writing fluency. Include the English translations for
            your sentences. These sentences must relate to the crime, helping the detective with useful information or
            questions for his case. </p>

        <ul>
            <li>One sentence must contain a noun-adjective pair.</li>
            <li>One sentence must contain a semi-deponent verb.</li>
            <li>One sentence must contain the name of one of the suspects, witnesses, or informants.</li>

                    <h2>Detective Notes: Composing Sentences with Deponents</h2>
                    <p>Writing sentences in English versus Latin are two very different processes! Latin word order is
                        different from English word order. Composing sentences with subjunctive verbs is not much
                        different than composing sentences with indicative verbs. Let this be your guide for dependent
                        subjunctive clauses! </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Deponent verbs always appear with Passive voice endings. Translate deponents in the Active
                            voice.</li>
                        <li>Semi-deponent verbs appear in the Active voice in the present system and Passive voice in
                            the perfect system. Translate semi-deponents in the Active voice. </li>
