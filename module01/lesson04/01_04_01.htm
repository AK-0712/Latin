		<h1>Missing: Priceless Palladium</h1>
		<p>A notice must immediately be posted around Rome to let all know that the Palladium has been stolen! Detective
			Arcanus needs you to design this "missing" flyer. Your post will be pasted on all the brick walls across
			Rome, so make it stand out. We need more witnesses to come forth with any information they may have. For
			this assignment, create a flyer detailing information about the missing Palladium. </p>

						<p class="text-center"><strong>Who took it?</strong> </p>
						<p>A thief stole our precious Palladium statue from the Temple of Vesta! Without the Palladium
							in its resting place, Rome is doomed!</p>
						<p class="text-center"><strong>Why find it?</strong> </p>
						<p>We want to know <em>where</em> the Palladium is, but first we need to know <em>what</em> it
							is. A description of its physical attributes as well as its cultural and historical
							importance should help the detective track it down!</p>

						<p class="text-center"><strong>What do you know?</strong> </p>
						<p>Detective Arcanus is on the case. He has narrowed down his suspects to five individuals. He
							believes they all had motives to steal the Palladium. He needs to figure out motive, means,
							and opportunity for each suspect. So far, he has managed to interview one witness—a Vestal
							Priestess who was there when the crime occurred.</p>


						<p class="text-center"><strong>Any Information?</strong> </p>
						<p>If anyone has information about the theft at the temple, please contact Detective Arcanus
							immediately. He can be found on the streets of Rome, interviewing people and wearing his
							brown cape and sandals. He’s desperate to solve this crime! </p>
						<p>Please come forward to help solve the case. Do it for <em>Roma</em> (or for the sizable
							reward)!</p>
