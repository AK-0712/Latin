        <p>You have finished the introduction <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>. This <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span> introduced you to your <em>whodunit</em> mystery and its characters. Pay close attention to your lessons because they are full of clues revealing the thief. While solving the mystery, you will raise your Latin skills on your way to Latin fluency! Watch for important highlights throughout these lessons.</p>

        <p>For your next clue, you will take a pretest with questions on the material for this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span> to see what you already know. Don't worry—this assessment will have very little impact on your overall score for the course. However, it will give you a clue about what's to come in this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>. It will also help you understand how you will be assessed at the end of the <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>. </p>
