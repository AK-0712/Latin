		<h1>Attention! Attention! This just in!</h1>
		<p>A theft has occurred at the Roman Forum in the Temple of Vesta! </p>
		<p>Oh no! It’s the Palladium statue…only one of the most sacred, precious, and powerful objects the world has
			ever known. Legend has it that a city which possesses the statue is divinely protected from invasion and
			captivity. Should the Palladium leave the city’s walls, destruction, darkness, and utter despair await its
			residents. </p>
		<p>The Palladium <em>must</em> immediately be returned to the Temple of Vesta, or the destiny of Rome is…doomed!
		</p>
		<p>Sleuth, we’re counting on you to figure out who stole the Palladium statue. Witnesses saw a shadowy figure
			running out of the temple with a statue. <em>Whodunit</em>? Why was it stolen? Piece together the clues in
			this course and solve this mystery for us. Please hurry. Catch our thief. Find the Palladium...before it's
			too late.</p>

					<p>As you move forward in the course, you will see a globe. It provides a translation to help your
						reading comprehension. Remember to keep an eye out for the globe whenever you need support, but
						always try to read the Latin first! You will be surprised just how much you understand!</p>
